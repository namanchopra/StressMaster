# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements StressMaster, a local-first AI-powered load testing tool that accepts natural language commands to perform API load testing. The system uses a local LLM (LLaMA3 via Ollama) to parse user prompts and convert them into structured load test specifications that can be executed using K6 or similar tools. The entire solution runs locally in Docker containers without requiring any cloud services or backend infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to describe load tests in natural language, so that I can quickly create and run API load tests without writing complex scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs a natural language command like "Send 50 POST requests to https://api.com with random orderIds" THEN the system SHALL parse the command and extract the HTTP method, URL, request count, and payload requirements
2. WHEN the system receives a natural language prompt THEN it SHALL use the local LLaMA3 model via Ollama to interpret the command
3. WHEN parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL convert the parsed information into a structured load test specification including method, URL, payload template, RPS, duration, and other parameters

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI to generate executable load test scripts, so that I can run the tests immediately without manual script creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a structured load test spec is created THEN the system SHALL generate a K6 script or equivalent that implements the specified test parameters
2. WHEN generating scripts THEN the system SHALL support dynamic payload generation for parameters like random IDs, timestamps, and other variable data
3. WHEN the script is generated THEN it SHALL include proper error handling and result reporting capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the entire system locally in Docker, so that I have no dependencies on external services or costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL run entirely within Docker containers on the local machine
2. WHEN starting the system THEN it SHALL automatically download and configure the LLaMA3 model via Ollama locally
3. WHEN running THEN the system SHALL not require any internet connectivity except for initial model download and target API testing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interact with the AI through a CLI or chat interface, so that I can easily communicate my load testing requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL provide either a command-line interface or chat interface for user interaction
2. WHEN a user submits a command THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback on the parsing and execution process
3. WHEN load tests complete THEN the system SHALL display results in a readable format including response times, success rates, and error details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute various types of HTTP requests with different payload templates, so that I can test different API scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specifying requests THEN the system SHALL support GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other HTTP methods
2. WHEN defining payloads THEN the system SHALL support template variables for generating dynamic data like random IDs, UUIDs, timestamps, and custom values
3. WHEN executing tests THEN the system SHALL be able to handle different content types including JSON, XML, and form data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to control load test parameters like request rate and duration, so that I can simulate realistic traffic patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN describing a test THEN the system SHALL allow specification of total request count, requests per second (RPS), or test duration
2. WHEN parsing commands THEN the system SHALL interpret time-based descriptions like "for 5 minutes" or "at 10 RPS"
3. WHEN executing tests THEN the system SHALL maintain the specified load pattern and provide progress updates

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform various types of load testing scenarios, so that I can comprehensively test my APIs under different conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specifying load tests THEN the system SHALL support spike testing by interpreting commands like "spike test with 1000 requests in 10 seconds"
2. WHEN describing tests THEN the system SHALL support stress testing by gradually increasing load over time based on natural language descriptions
3. WHEN configuring tests THEN the system SHALL support endurance testing for extended periods with sustained load
4. WHEN setting up tests THEN the system SHALL support volume testing with large numbers of concurrent users or requests
5. WHEN defining scenarios THEN the system SHALL support baseline testing to establish performance benchmarks

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create complex multi-step load testing scenarios, so that I can test realistic user workflows and API interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN describing workflows THEN the system SHALL support chained requests where one request's response feeds into the next request
2. WHEN specifying scenarios THEN the system SHALL support user session simulation with login, actions, and logout sequences
3. WHEN defining tests THEN the system SHALL support conditional logic based on response codes or content
4. WHEN creating scenarios THEN the system SHALL support data correlation between requests using response data
5. WHEN setting up workflows THEN the system SHALL support think time and realistic delays between requests

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive reporting and analysis of load test results, so that I can identify performance bottlenecks and issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL provide detailed performance metrics including response times, throughput, and error rates
2. WHEN analyzing results THEN the system SHALL generate percentile breakdowns (50th, 90th, 95th, 99th percentiles) for response times
3. WHEN reporting THEN the system SHALL identify and highlight performance degradation points and error patterns
4. WHEN tests finish THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations based on the results using the AI model
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL support exporting results in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, HTML reports)
